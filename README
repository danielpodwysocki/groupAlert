The purpose of this project is to send e-mail and sms alerts from locations specified by a get parameter. It is functional,
however I wouldn't use it if you think that you might need to update it since this project is pretty much abandoned
due to it being a very early effort of mine. Because of that the quality of code is really lacking and navigating it
would be difficult. It would honestly be easier for me to re-write this app rather than update it.

If I didn't manage to scare you off and you want to try it anyways, here's information you might need:
  $token in sendAlert.php must be changed to your smsapi token.
  Same with your mail login and pass, file mail.py
  you need python3 installed for mails to work
  the name of the location from which the alert is being sent is specified by the location GET param, so an example
  URL might look something like that: /alerts?location=machine1
  You need to manually create a database entry for the admin account. The password hashing
  algo is Bcrypt (I believe it's 9 rounds, but you can find it in PHP docs).

If you really need such a project and can't get  feel free to contact me - I could help you with getting it running.
However, as mentioned there won't be any updates to this, since the codebase would be a nightmare to work with.
